### Overview
The Underwater Camera unit is designed for marine data collection. The tag is geared for video recording and GPS data collection, as well as sensor data logging. This device can be used as a POV camera for aquatic turtles, or in stationary monitoring applications. The tags operating parameters are configured through a web user interface. 
### Operation
