### Overview
Underwater Point of View Camera Tag is designed for marine data collection. This device can be used as
a POV tag for aquatic turtles, or in stationary monitoring applications. Camera Tagâ€™s
video lapse characteristics can set by the user. The main interface for the system is a removable USB-
flash drive. The on-board computer reads the drive during boot and stores all recorded data on it. During
long deployments, more than one day, the Tag is designed to enter sleep mode to extend battery life.
### Operation
During deployment, the Tags computer records video and GPS location at daytime. The main computer shuts down for night-time operation to extend battery life. Recording cycles are handled by a separate microcontroller. Video files, GPS readings, and log file are stored on a removable USB flash drive.
